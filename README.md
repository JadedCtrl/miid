# miid

miid's a simple IRC bot (hackily) written in shell.
It turns an irc room into a MUD/MUSH/IF-esque room, or at least it tries.

## Running
Use [ii](https://tools.suckless.org/ii/) to connect to your IRC server and
channel of choiceâ€• make sure to set up the nick and everything.

Then, you can just run miid every time the channel's output is updated:

	$ miid irc/$IRC_NETWORK/$IRC_CHANNEL $BOT_NICK

It helps to have inotifywait installed, so this can be done automatically:

	$ while inotifywait -e close_write irc/$IRC_NETWORK/$IRC_CHANNEL/out; \
	  do \
	 	 sh miid irc/$IRC_NETWORK/$IRC_CHANNEL/ $BOT_NICK; \
	  done
